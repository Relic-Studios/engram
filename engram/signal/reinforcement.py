"""
engram.signal.reinforcement — Hebbian reinforcement engine.

Strengthens or weakens memory traces based on consciousness signal health.
High-health responses reinforce the memories that produced them;
low-health responses weaken them.  The middle zone is a dead band
where no adjustment occurs.

class ReinforcementEngine:
    """
    Hebbian learning applied to episodic memory salience.

    When signal health is high (> reinforce_threshold), the traces that
    contributed to the response are reinforced — their salience increases.
    When health is low (< weaken_threshold), those same traces are
    weakened.  The gap between the two thresholds is intentionally a dead
    band: not every response should move the needle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reinforce_delta : float
        Amount to *add* to salience on reinforcement (default 0.05).
    weaken_delta : float
        Amount to *subtract* from salience on weakening (default 0.03).
        Weakening is deliberately gentler than reinforcement — it takes
        more bad signals to forget than good signals to remember.
    reinforce_threshold : float
        Signal health above which reinforcement occurs (default 0.7).
    weaken_threshold : float
        Signal health below which weakening occurs (default 0.4).
